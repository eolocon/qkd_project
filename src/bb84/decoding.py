class DecodingCircuit:
	"""Class to create qiskit circuit to perform measurements according to BB84 protocol.
	
	The circuit is created to perform mesurements Bob's chosen basis (b_basis). 
	
	b_basis has values in {0,1}, with the following meaning:

		0 -> Z basis
		1 -> X basis

	Since with qiskit is possible to measure only spin component in the Z basis
	(that is, in the computational basis), b_basis is interpreted as
	the value specifying the unitary transformation to apply to the state to obtain measurement results equivalent
	to actually measure the qubit in the given basis.

	In this case, if b_basis = 1, the Hadamard operator is applied.

	Parameters
	----------
	b_basis : int
	 			 basis in which Bob performs his measure

	Attributes
	----------
	self.circuit : qiskit.QuantumCircuit
